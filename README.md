# **Decentralized Voting System**  

This project is a **blockchain-based voting system** designed to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof elections. By leveraging **smart contracts**, it eliminates the risks associated with traditional voting systems, such as fraud, data manipulation, and central authority control.  

## **Features**  
- **Blockchain Security**: Ensures immutable and transparent vote recording.  
- **Smart Contracts**: Automates vote validation and result calculation.  
- **Decentralization**: Eliminates central authority control, reducing election fraud.  
- **User Authentication**: Secure voter registration and identity verification.  
- **Real-time Vote Counting**: Instant and transparent vote tallying.  

## **Technology Stack**  
- **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum  
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js  
- **Frontend**: React.js / HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Database**: IPFS / MongoDB (if applicable)  
- **Development Tools**: Truffle, Ganache, MetaMask  

## **How to Use**  
1. **Deploy the smart contract** on a blockchain network (Ethereum testnet).  
2. **Voter Registration**: Securely register eligible voters.  
3. **Casting Votes**: Voters interact with the smart contract to submit their vote.  
4. **Result Calculation**: The system automatically tallies votes and displays the results.  

## **Applications**  
- National and local elections  
- University and organizational voting  
- Secure online decision-making systems
